# Getting Started

Welcome to Roselite! This guide will help you get up and running with P2P static site hosting in minutes.

## What you'll learn

In this section, you'll learn how to:

- [Install Roselite](installation.md) on your system
- [Deploy your first site](quick-start.md) to the Veilid DHT
- [Set up a gateway](first-deployment.md) for web access
- Understand the [basic workflow](quick-start.md) for P2P hosting

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

- **Rust 1.70+** with Cargo installed
- **Internet connection** for Veilid network bootstrap
- **Static site files** ready for deployment (HTML, CSS, JS)

## Quick overview

Roselite follows a simple four-step process:

1. **Bundle** your static site into a `.veilidpkg` format
2. **Publish** the package to the Veilid DHT
3. **Start** a gateway server for web access
4. **Share** your gateway URL with the world

The entire process takes less than 5 minutes from start to finish.
