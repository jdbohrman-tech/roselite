title: Quick Start
description: Deploy your first decentralized site with Roselite in minutes
---

This guide will walk you through deploying your first static site to the decentralized web using Roselite. You'll go from zero to deployed in just a few minutes!

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- ✅ [Roselite CLI installed](./installation/)
- ✅ A static site ready for deployment
- ✅ Internet connection

## Important: Current Gateway Status

**Universal gateways are not yet deployed.** For now, you'll need to run a local gateway for web access. Universal gateways like `gateway.roselite.network` will be available in a future release.

**Current options:**
- Use local gateway for development/testing
- Deploy your own gateway for production
- Set up custom domains with DNS TXT records

## Step 1: Prepare Your Site

For this example, we'll create a simple static site. You can also use any existing static site or one generated by Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, etc.

### Option A: Create a Sample Site

```bash
# Create a simple test site
mkdir my-first-roselite-site
cd my-first-roselite-site

# Create index.html
cat > index.html << 'EOF'
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Roselite Site</title>
    <style>
        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 40px; }
        h1 { color: #DF3281; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Decentralized Web!</h1>
    <p>This site is hosted on the Veilid DHT via Roselite.</p>
    <p>It's censorship-resistant and will persist as long as the network exists.</p>
</body>
</html>
EOF

# Create a CSS file
cat > style.css << 'EOF'
body {
    font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 40px;
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
    color: white;
    min-height: 100vh;
}

h1 {
    color: #DF3281;
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 30px;
}
EOF
```

### Option B: Use Your Existing Site

If you have an existing static site, simply navigate to its directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/static/site
```

Make sure all files are in the current directory or subdirectories.

## Step 2: Bundle Your Site

First, package your static site into a Veilid package:

```bash
roselite bundle . --name "My First Site" --description "My first decentralized website"
```

This command will:
1. Scan your directory for files
2. Create a .veilidpkg package file
3. Prompt for any missing metadata

**Available bundle options:**
- `--name` - Human-readable name for your site
- `--version` - Version string (defaults to "1.0.0")
- `--description` - Description of your site
- `--developer` - Your name or organization
- `--entry` - Entry point file (defaults to "index.html")
- `--tags` - Comma-separated tags
- `--output` - Output package file path

Expected output:
```
🏗️  Bundling site from: /path/to/your/site
📦 Package: My First Site v1.0.0 by Your Name
✅ Package created: my-first-site.veilidpkg
📦 Size: 1,234 bytes
```

## Step 3: Publish to the DHT

Now for the exciting part - publishing to the decentralized web!

```bash
roselite publish my-first-site.veilidpkg
```

This command will:
1. Connect to the Veilid DHT network
2. Upload your package to the distributed hash table
3. Provide instructions for accessing your content

**Available publish options:**
- `--gateways` - Show all available gateway URLs
- `--open` - Automatically open the site in your browser after publishing

Expected output:
```
📤 Publishing package: my-first-site.veilidpkg
📦 Package: My First Site v1.0.0 by Your Name
🌐 Connecting to Veilid DHT...
✅ Successfully connected to Veilid network!
📡 Publishing to Veilid DHT...
✅ Package published successfully!

📊 DHT Record Details:
   📋 App ID: abc123def456...
   📈 Version: 1.0.0
   🔗 DHT Record Key: abc123def456...
   📡 Storage: Veilid distributed hash table

⚠️  WEB ACCESS SETUP REQUIRED:
Universal gateways are not yet deployed. To access your site:

1. 🏠 Run Local Gateway (Development):
   cd roselite-gateway && cargo run
   Access: http://localhost:8080/abc123def456

2. 🌐 Deploy Your Own Gateway (Production):
   See: /api/gateway-api/#custom-domain-setup

3. 📱 Custom Domain Setup (Advanced):
   See instructions below

🎉 Your content is now stored in the decentralized DHT!
```

## Step 4: Set Up Web Access

Since universal gateways aren't deployed yet, choose one of these options:

### Option A: Local Gateway (Development)

For development and testing:

```bash
# In a separate terminal, run the gateway
cd roselite-gateway
cargo run

# Your gateway will be available at:
# http://localhost:8080
```

Then access your site:
```bash
# Direct access via DHT key
curl http://localhost:8080/abc123def456

# Or open in browser
open http://localhost:8080/abc123def456
```

### Option B: Custom Domain Setup (Production)

For production use with your own domain:

#### 1. Deploy Gateway to Your Server

```bash
# On your server (Ubuntu/Debian example)
git clone https://github.com/jdbohrman-tech/roselite.git
cd roselite/roselite-gateway

# Build and run
cargo build --release
sudo ./target/release/roselite-gateway --port 80

# Or run with systemd
sudo systemctl enable roselite-gateway
sudo systemctl start roselite-gateway
```

#### 2. Configure DNS Records

Set up DNS records for your domain:

```dns
# Required: TXT record with your DHT key
example.com. IN TXT "veilid-app=abc123def456"
example.com. IN TXT "veilid-version=1.0.0"

# Required: Point domain to your gateway server
example.com. IN A 192.168.1.100

# Or use CNAME if gateway is on another domain
example.com. IN CNAME your-gateway-server.com
```

#### 3. Test Your Setup

```bash
# Verify DNS records
dig TXT example.com

# Test gateway resolution
curl http://example.com/abc123def456

# Test custom domain (if configured)
curl http://example.com
```

#### 4. Set Up HTTPS (Recommended)

```bash
# Install certbot
sudo apt install certbot

# Get SSL certificate
sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com

# Your site will be available at:
# https://example.com
```

## Step 5: Access Your Site

Once you have a gateway running, you can access your site:

**Local Development:**
```
http://localhost:8080/abc123def456
```

**Custom Domain:**
```
https://your-domain.com
```

## Understanding Your Deployment

### DHT Storage
Your content is now stored in the Veilid DHT:
- **Decentralized**: Replicated across multiple nodes
- **Permanent**: Persists as long as the network exists
- **Addressable**: Unique DHT key for global access

### Gateway Role
Gateways provide HTTP access to DHT content:
- **Translation**: Convert DHT keys to web URLs
- **HTTP Bridge**: Standard web browser access
- **Custom Domains**: DNS TXT record resolution

### Current Limitations
- **No Universal Gateways**: Must run your own or use localhost
- **Manual Setup**: DNS and gateway configuration required
- **HTTPS**: Need to configure SSL certificates yourself

## Advanced: DNS TXT Record Details

The DNS TXT record format is:

```dns
# Primary record (required)
domain.com. IN TXT "veilid-app=abc123def456"

# Version record (optional but recommended)
domain.com. IN TXT "veilid-version=1.0.0"

# Additional metadata (optional)
domain.com. IN TXT "veilid-description=My Site Description"
domain.com. IN TXT "veilid-developer=Your Name"
```

### Multiple Sites per Domain

You can host multiple sites using subdomains:

```dns
# Main site
example.com. IN TXT "veilid-app=abc123def456"

# Blog subdomain
blog.example.com. IN TXT "veilid-app=def789ghi012"

# Portfolio subdomain
portfolio.example.com. IN TXT "veilid-app=ghi345jkl678"
```

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your first site to the decentralized web. Here's what you can do next:

- React app built with Create React App
- Documentation site
- Portfolio site

### 🔧 Production Setup
For production use:
- Deploy your own gateway server
- Set up custom domain with HTTPS
- Configure DNS TXT records

curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Check Veilid DHT connection
roselite access abc123def456
```

### DNS Resolution Issues
```bash
# Verify TXT records
dig TXT example.com

# Test from different DNS servers
dig @8.8.8.8 TXT example.com
dig @1.1.1.1 TXT example.com
```

### Content Not Found
- Verify the DHT key is correct
- Check if content was successfully published
- Try accessing via CLI: `roselite access <dht-key>`

### Universal Gateway Timeline

We're actively working on deploying universal gateways:

- **Phase 1** (Current): Local gateway development
- **Phase 2** (Next): Single public gateway deployment  
- **Phase 3** (Future): Multi-region gateway network
