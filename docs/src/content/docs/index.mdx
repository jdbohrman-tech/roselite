## How It Works

Roselite leverages the **Veilid Distributed Hash Table (DHT)** to create a robust, decentralized hosting platform:

1. **Bundle**: Use the Roselite CLI to package your static site into a .veilidpkg file
2. **Publish**: Upload the package to the DHT network where it's automatically replicated
3. **Access**: Your content lives in the DHT and can be accessed via gateways
4. **Persist**: Your content remains available as long as the network exists

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Roselite CLI
git clone https://github.com/jdbohrman-tech/roselite.git
cd roselite && cargo install --path roselite-cli

# Bundle your site
roselite bundle ./my-site --name "My Site"

# Publish to the decentralized web
roselite publish my-site.veilidpkg

# Set up web access (gateway required)
# See Getting Started guide for gateway setup
```

<Card title="Ready to get started?" icon="open-book">
  Head over to our [Getting Started guide](/getting-started/) to deploy your first decentralized site. **Note**: Universal gateways are not yet deployed - you'll need to run a local gateway or set up your own infrastructure for web access.
